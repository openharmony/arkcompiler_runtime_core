Error Handling
##############

.. meta:
    frontend_status: Done

|LANG| is designed to provide first-class support in responding to, and
recovering from different error situations in a program. Normal program
execution can be interrupted by the occurrence of situations of two kinds:

-  Runtime errors (e.g., null pointer dereferencing, array bounds
   checking, or division by zero);

-  Operation completion failures (e.g., the task of reading
   and processing data from a file on disk can fail if the file does
   not exist on a specified path, read permissions are not available,
   or else).

The term *error* in this Specification denotes all kinds of error situations.

*Error* is the base class of all error situations. Defining a new
error class is normally not required because essential error classes for
various cases (e.g., ``RangeError``) are defined in the
standard library (see :ref:`Standard Library`).

However, a developer can handle a new error situation by using ``Error``
class itself, or by a subclass of ``Error``. An example of error
handling is provided below:

.. index::
   error
   base class
   class
   error handling
   derived class
   standard library


.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

   class UnknownError extends Error { // User-defined error class 
      error: Error
      constructor (error: Error) {
         super()
         this.error = error
      }
    }

    function get_array_element<T>(array: T[], index: int): T|undefined {
        try {
          return array[index] // RangeError if index < 0 or index >= array.length
        }
        catch (error) {
          if (error instanceof RangeError) // invalid index detected
             return undefined
          throw new UnknownError (error) // Unknown error occurred
        }
    }

    let arr = [1, 2, 3]
    let val = get_array_element(arr, -3) // RangeError: index -3 < 0

   console.log(val) // output: undefined


In most cases, errors are raised by the |LANG| runtime system, or by the
standard library (see :ref:`Standard Library`) code.

New error situations can be created and raised by ``throw`` statements (see
:ref:`Throw Statements`) .

Errors are handled by using ``try`` statements (see :ref:`Try Statements`).

.. note::
   Some errors cannot be recovered.

      handling_actions : () => void)
    {
      try {
        actions()
      }
      catch (x) { // Type of x is Error
          handling_actions()
      }
    }
