Experimental Features
#####################

.. meta:
    frontend_status: Partly

This Chapter introduces the |LANG| features that are considered parts of
the language, but have no counterpart in |TS|, and are therefore not
recommended to those who seek a single source code for |TS| and |LANG|.

Some features introduced in this Chapter are still under discussion. They can
be removed from the final version of the |LANG| specification. Once a feature
introduced in this Chapter is approved and/or implemented, the corresponding
section is moved to the body of the specification as appropriate.

The *array creation* feature introduced in
:ref:`Resizable Array Creation Expressions` enables programmers to create
objects of the array type at runmtime by providing the following as arguments:

- Array size;
- One element to fill the array with, or a lambda to generate a set of elements
  to fill the array with.

This addition is useful to other array-related features of the language, such
as array literals. This feature can also be used to create arrays of arrays.

Overloading functions, methods, or constructors is a practical and convenient
way to write program actions that are similar in logic but different in
implementation. |LANG| uses :ref:`Explicit Overload Declarations` as an innovative
form of *managed overloading*.

   constructor
   function
   method
   array type
   runtime
   array size
   function overloading
   method overloading
   implementation
   constructor overloading
   overload declaration

Section :ref:`Native Functions and Methods` introduces practically important
and useful mechanisms for the inclusion of components written in other languages
into a program written in |LANG|.

Sections :ref:`Final Classes` and :ref:`Final Methods`
discuss the well-known feature that
in many OOP languages provides a way to restrict class inheritance and method
overriding. Making a class *final* prohibits defining classes derived from it,
whereas making a method *final* prevents it from overriding in derived classes.

Section :ref:`Adding Functionality to Existing Types` discusses the way to
add new functionality to an already defined type.

Section :ref:`Enumeration Methods` adds methods to declarations of the
enumeration types. Such methods can help in some kinds of manipulations
with ``enums``.

The |LANG| language supports writing concurrent applications in the form of
|C_JOBS| (see :ref:`Execution model`) that allow executing
functions concurrently.

There is a basic set of language constructs that support concurrency. A function
to be launched asynchronously is marked by adding the modifier ``async``
to its declaration. In addition, any function or lambda expression can be
launched as a separate thread explicitly by using the launch function from
the standard library.

.. _Type char:

Type ``char``
*************

.. meta:
    frontend_status: Partly

Values of ``char`` type are Unicode code points.

.. list-table::
   :width: 100%
   :widths: 15 60
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Type
     - Type's Set of Values
   * - ``char`` (32-bits)
     - Symbols with codes from \U+0000 to \U+10FFFF (maximum valid Unicode code
       point) inclusive

Predefined constructors, methods, and constants for ``char`` type are
parts of the |LANG| :ref:`Standard Library`.

Type ``char`` is a class type that has an appropriate class as a part of the
:ref:`Standard Library`. It means that type ``char`` is a subtype of
``Object``, and that it can be used at any place where a class name is
expected.

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    let a_char = new char
    console.log (a_char)
    // Output is: <empty_char>
    let o: Object = a_char // OK

.. _Character Literals:

Character Literals
==================

.. meta:
    frontend_status: Done

*Character literal* represents the following:

-  Value consisting of a single character; or
-  Single escape sequence preceded by the characters *single quote* (U+0027)
   and '*c*' (U+0063), and followed by a *single quote* U+0027).

The syntax of *character literal* is represented below:

.. code-block:: abnf

      CharLiteral:
          'c\'' SingleQuoteCharacter '\''
          ;

      SingleQuoteCharacter:
          ~['\\\r\n]
          | '\\' EscapeSequence
          ;

The examples are presented below:

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

      c'a'
      c'\n'
      c'\x7F'
      c'\u0000'

*Character literals* are of type ``char``.

.. index::

.. _Character Equality and Relational Operators:

Character Equality and Relational Operators
===========================================

.. meta:
    frontend_status: Partly
    todo: need to adapt the implementation to the latest specification

*Value equality* is used for operands of type ``char``.

If both operands represent the same Unicode code point,
then the result of ':math:`==`' or ':math:`===`'
is ``true``. Otherwise, the result is ``false``.
The result of ':math:`!=`' and ':math:`!==`' is ``false`` when values are same.
Otherwise, the result is ``true``.

Attempting to use type ``char`` as an operand in a relational expression causes
a :index:`compile-time error` if detected at compile time, or a
:index:`runtime error` otherwise:

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

   let a0 = new char
   let a1 = new char
   a0 = c'a'
   a1 = c'a'

   // Both next lines print true
   console.log(a0 == a1)
   console.log(a0 === a1)

   let x: number = 1
   // Any relational operator with char causes compile-time error
   a0 < a1 // Compile-time error
   a0 < x  // Compile-time error

   // Equality where one operand is char and the other is non-char causes error
   a0 == x  // compile-time error

   // Example with runtime error
   let u: char | number;

   u = c'x'
   u == a0  // OK, both operands are `char`
   u = 1.0
   u == a0  // run time error, comparing `char` with `number`

.. _Fixed-Size Array Types:

Fixed-Size Array Types
**********************

.. meta:
    frontend_status: Partly

*Fixed-size array type*, written as ``FixedArray<T>``, is the built-in type
characterized by the following:

-  Any instance of array type contains elements. The number of elements is known
   as *array length*, and can be accessed by using the ``length`` property.
-  Array length is a non-negative integer number.
-  Array length is set once at runtime and cannot be changed after that.
-  Array element is accessed by its index. *Index* is an integer number
   starting from *0* to *array length minus 1*.
-  Accessing an element by its index is a constant-time operation.
-  If passed to a non-|LANG| environment, an array is represented as a contiguous
   memory location.
-  Type of each array element is assignable to the element's type specified
   in the array declaration (see :ref:`Assignability`).

*Fixed-size arrays* differ from *resizable arrays* as follows:

- Fixed-size array length is set once to achieve better performance;
- Fixed-size arrays have no methods defined;
- Fixed-size arrays have several constructors (see
  :ref:`Fixed-Size Array Creation`);
- Fixed-size arrays are not compatible with *resizable arrays*.

Incompatibility between a resizable array and a fixed-size array is represented
by the example below:

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    function foo(a: FixedArray<number>, b: Array<number>) {
        a = b // compile-time error
        b = a // compile-time error
    }

.. _Fixed-Size Array Creation:

Fixed-Size Array Creation
=========================

.. meta:
    frontend_status: Partly

*Fixed-size array* can be created by using :ref:`Array Literal` or
constructors defined for type ``FixedArray<T>``, where ``T`` must be a
concrete type. A :index:`compile time error` occurs if ``T`` is a type parameter.

The use of an *array literal* to create an array is represented in the following
example:

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    let a : FixedArray<number> = [1, 2, 3]
      /* create array with 3 elements of type number */
    a[1] = 7 /* put 7 as the 2nd element of the array, index of this element is 1 */
    let y = a[2] /* get the last element of array 'a' */
    let count = a.length // get the number of array elements
    y = a[3] // Will cause a runtime error - attempt to access non-existing array element

.. index::
   fixed-size array type
   array length
   array literal
   constructor
   fixed-size array
   integer
   array element
   access
   assignability
   resizable array
   runtime error

Several constructors can be called to create a ``FixedArray<T>`` instance as
follows:

- ``constructor(len: int)``, if type ``T`` has either a default value (see
  :ref:`Default Values for Types`) or a constructor that can be called with
  no argument provided:

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    // type ``number`` has a default value:
    let a = new FixedArray<number>(3) // creates array [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]

    class C {
        constructor (n?: number) {}
    }
    let b = new FixedArray<C>(2) // creates array [new C(), new C()]

- ``constructor(len: int, elem: T)`` for any ``T``. The constructor creates an
  array instance filled with a single value ``elem``:

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    let a = new FixedArray<string>(3, "a") // creates array ["a", "a", "a"]

- ``constructor(len: int, elems: (inx: int) => T)`` for any ``T``. The
  constructor creates an array instance where each *i* element is evaluated
  as a result of the ``elems`` call with argument *i*:

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    let a = new FixedArray<int>(3, (inx: int) => 3 - inx )
    // creates array [3, 2, 1]

.. _Resizable Array Creation Expressions:

Resizable Array Creation Expressions
************************************

.. meta:
    frontend_status: Done

*Array creation expression* creates new objects that are instances of *resizable
arrays* (see :ref:`Resizable Array Types`). An array instance can be created
alternatively by using :ref:`Array literal`.

The syntax of *array creation expression* is presented below:

.. code-block:: abnf

      newArrayInstance:
          'new' arrayElementType dimensionExpression+ arrayElement
          ;

      arrayElementType:
          typeReference
          | '(' type ')'
          ;

      dimensionExpression:
          '[' expression ']'
          ;

      arrayElement:
          '(' expression ')'
          ;

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

      let x = new number[2][2] (0) // create 2x2 matrix filled with 0 value

.. index::
   resizable array
   array creation expression
   object
   instance
   array
   array instance
   array literal
   syntax
   expression

*Array creation expression* creates an object that is a new array with the
elements of the type specified by ``arrayElementType``.

The type of each *dimension expression* must be assignable (see
:ref:`Assignability`) to an ``int`` type. Otherwise,
a :index:`compile-time error` occurs.

A :index:`compile-time error` occurs if any *dimension expression* is a
constant expression that is evaluated to a negative integer value at compile
time.

Type of ``arrayElement`` ``expression`` must be one of the two:

- Type of array element denoted by ``arrayElementType``, or
- Lambda function with the return type equal to the type of array element
  denoted by ``arrayElementType`` and the parameters of type ``int``, and the
  number of parameters equal to the number of array dimensions.

Otherwise, a :index:`compile-time error` occurs.

A :index:`compile-time error` occurs if ``arrayElementType`` is a type
parameter:

   :linenos:

      class A<T> {
         foo(element: T) {
            new T[2] (element) // compile-time error: cannot create an array of type parameter elements
         }
      }

The creation of an array with a known number of elements is presented below:

   :linenos:

      class A {
        constructor (x: number) {}
      }

      let array_size = 5

      let array1 = new A[array_size] (new A(1))
         /* Create array of 'array_size' elements and all of them will have
            initial value equal to an object created by new A expression */

      let array2 = new A[array_size] ((index): A => { return new A(index) })
         /* Create array of `array_size` elements and all of them will have
            initial value equal to the result of lambda function execution with
            different indices */

      let array2 = new A[2][3] ((index1, index2): A => { return new A(index1 * index2) })
         /* Create array of arrays of 6 elements total and all of them will
            have initial value equal to the result of lambda function execution with
            different indices */

.. _Runtime Evaluation of Array Creation Expressions:

Runtime Evaluation of Array Creation Expressions
================================================

.. meta:
    frontend_status: Partly
    todo: initialize array elements properly - #14963, #15610

The evaluation of an array creation expression at runtime is performed
as follows:

#. The dimension expressions are evaluated. The evaluation is performed
   left-to-right. If any expression evaluation completes abruptly, then
   the expressions to the right of it are not evaluated.

#. The values of dimension expressions are checked. If the value of any
   dimension expression is less than zero, then ``NegativeArraySizeError``
   is thrown.

#. Space for the new array is allocated. If the available space is not
   sufficient to allocate the array, then ``OutOfMemoryError`` is thrown,
   and the evaluation of the array creation expression completes abruptly.

#. When a one-dimensional array is created, each element of the array is
   initialized either with the value passed or by calls to the lambda
   generating a set of values.

#. When array with several dimensions is created,
   the array creation effectively executes a set of nested loops of depth *n-1*.

.. _Enumerations Experimental:

Enumerations Experimental
*************************

Several experimental features described below are available for enumerations.

.. _Enumeration with Explicit Type:

Enumeration with Explicit Type
==============================

.. meta:
    frontend_status: None

*Enumeration with explicit type* uses the following syntax:

.. code-block:: abnf

    enumDeclaration:
        'const'? 'enum' identifier ':' type '{' enumConstantList? '}'
        ;

All enumeration constants of a declared enumeration are of the *explicit type*
specified in the declaration, i.e., the *explicit type* is the
*enumeration base type* (see :ref:`Enumerations` and :ref:`Const Enumerations`).

.. index::
   enumeration base type
   enumeration with explicit type
   syntax
   enumeration constant
   enumeration
   declaration
   explicit type

If *explicit type* is an integer type then omitted values for constants allowed,
the same rules applied as for enum with non-explicit type (see :ref:`Enumeration Integer Values`).

A :index:`compile-time error` occurs in the following situations:

- *Explicit type* is different from any numeric or string type.
- Enumeration constant has no value and *Explicit type* is not an integer type.
- Enumeration constant type is not assignable (see :ref:`Assignability`)
  to the *explicit type*.

    enum LongEnum: long { A = 0, B = 1, C = 3 } // OK

    enum Wrong1: double { A, B, C } // compile-time error: must be explicitly initialized
    enum Wrong2: long { A = 1, B = "abc" } // compile-time error: not assignable to 'long'

|

.. _Enumeration Methods:

Enumeration Methods
===================

.. meta:
    frontend_status: Done

Several static methods are available for each enumeration class type as
follows:

-  Method ``static values()`` returns an array of enumeration constants
   in the order of declaration.
-  Method ``static getValueOf(name: string)`` returns an enumeration constant
   with the given name, or throws an error if no constant with such name
   exists.
-  Method ``static fromValue(value: T)``, where ``T`` is the base type
   of the enumeration, returns an enumeration constant with a given value, or
   throws an error if no constant has such a value.

.. index::
   enumeration method
   static method

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

      enum Color { Red, Green, Blue = 5 }
      let colors = Color.values()
      //colors[0] is the same as Color.Red

      let red = Color.getValueOf("Red")

      Color.fromValue(5) // ok, returns Color.Blue
      Color.fromValue(6) // throws runtime error

Additional methods for instances of an enumeration type are as follows:

-  Method ``valueOf()`` returns a numeric or ``string`` value of an enumeration
   constant depending on the type of the enumeration constant.

-  Method ``getName()`` returns the name of an enumeration constant.

.. code-block-meta:

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

      enum Color { Red, Green = 10, Blue }
      let c: Color = Color.Green
      console.log(c.valueOf()) // prints 10
      console.log(c.getName()) // prints Green

.. note::
   Methods ``c.toString()`` and ``c.valueOf().toString()`` return the same
   value.

.. _Indexable Types:

Indexable Types
***************

.. meta:
    frontend_status: Done

If a class or an interface declares one or two functions with names ``$_get``
and ``$_set``, and signatures *(index: Type1): Type2* and *(index: Type1,
value: Type2)* respectively, then an indexing expression (see
:ref:`Indexing Expressions`) can be applied to variables of such types:

.. code-block-meta:

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    class SomeClass {
       $_get (index: number): SomeClass { return this }
       $_set (index: number, value: SomeClass) { }
    }
    let x = new SomeClass
    x = x[1] // This notation implies a call: x = x.$_get (1)
    x[1] = x // This notation implies a call: x.$_set (1, x)

If only one function is present, then only the appropriate form of indexing
expression (see :ref:`Indexing Expressions`) is available:

.. index::
   indexable type
   interface
   class
   declaration
   function name
   function
   signature
   indexing expression
   variable
   type

.. code-block-meta:
   expect-cte:

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    class ClassWithGet {
       $_get (index: number): ClassWithGet { return this }
    }
    let getClass = new ClassWithGet
    getClass = getClass[0]
    getClass[0] = getClass // Error - no $_set function available

    class ClassWithSet {
       $_set (index: number, value: ClassWithSet) { }
    }
    let setClass = new ClassWithSet
    setClass = setClass[0] // Error - no $_get function available
    setClass[0] = setClass

Type ``string`` can be used as a type of the index parameter:

.. index::
   function
   indexing expression
   string
   string type
   type
   index parameter

.. code-block-meta:

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    class SomeClass {
       $_get (index: string): SomeClass { return this }
       $_set (index: string, value: SomeClass) { }
    }
    let x = new SomeClass
    x = x["index string"]
       // This notation implies a call: x = x.$_get ("index string")
    x["index string"] = x
       // This notation implies a call: x.$_set ("index string", x)

Functions ``$_get`` and ``$_set`` are ordinary functions with compiler-known
signatures. The functions can be used like any other function.
The functions can be abstract, or defined in an interface and implemented later.
The functions can be overridden and provide a dynamic dispatch for the indexing
expression evaluation (see :ref:`Indexing Expressions`). The functions can be
used in generic classes and interfaces for better flexibility. A
:index:`compile-time error` occurs if these functions are marked as ``async``.

.. _Iterable Types:

Iterable Types
**************

.. meta:
    frontend_status: Done

A class or an interface is *iterable* if it implements the interface ``Iterable``
defined in the :ref:`Standard Library`, and thus has an accessible parameterless
method with the name ``$_iterator`` and a return type that is a subtype (see
:ref:`Subtyping`) of type ``Iterator`` as defined in the :ref:`Standard Library`.
It guarantees that an object returned by the ``$_iterator`` method is of the
type which implements ``Iterator``, and thus allows traversing an object of the
*iterable* type.

A union of iterable types is also *iterable*. It means that instances of such
types can be used in ``for-of`` statements (see :ref:`For-Of Statements`).

Array (see :ref:`Array Types`) and string (see :ref:`Type string`) types are
iterable.

An *iterable* class ``C`` is represented in the example below:

.. index::
   iterable class
   class
   iterable interface
   interface
   parameterless method
   access
   accessibility
   subtyping
   subtype
   iterator
   instance
   for-of statement
   return type
   traversing
   assignability
   type Iterator
   implementation
   iterable type
   union
   for-of statement
   object

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

      class C implements Iterable<string> {
        data: string[] = ['a', 'b', 'c']
        $_iterator() { // Return type is inferred from the method body
          return new CIterator(this)
        }
      }

      class CIterator implements Iterator<string> {
        index = 0
        base: C
        constructor (base: C) {
          this.base = base
        }
        next(): IteratorResult<string> {
          return {
            done: this.index >= this.base.data.length,
            value: this.index >= this.base.data.length ? "" : this.base.data[this.index++]
          }
        }
      }

      let c = new C()
      for (let x of c) {
            console.log(x)
      }

In the example above, class ``C`` method ``$_iterator`` returns
``CIterator<string>`` that implements ``Iterator<string>``. If executed,
this code prints out the following:

.. code-block:: typescript

    "a"
    "b"
    "c"

The method ``$_iterator`` is an ordinary method with a compiler-known
signature. This method can be used like any other method. It can be
abstract or defined in an interface to be implemented later. A
:index:`compile-time error` occurs if this method is marked as ``async``.

.. index::
   type inference
   inferred type
   method
   method body
   ordinary method
   class
   iterator
   compiler-known signature
   compiler
   signature
   implementation
   async method

.. note::
   To support the code compatible with |TS|, the name of the method
   ``$_iterator`` can be written as ``[Symbol.iterator]``. In this case, the
   class ``iterable`` looks as follows:

   .. code-block-meta:

   .. code-block:: typescript
      :linenos:

         class C {
           data: string[] = ['a', 'b', 'c'];
           [Symbol.iterator]() {
             return new CIterator(this)
           }
         }

The use of the name ``[Symbol.iterator]`` is considered deprecated.
It can be removed in the future versions of the language.

.. _Callable Types:

Callable Types
**************

.. meta:
    frontend_status: Partly
    todo: add $_ to names

A type is *callable* if the name of the type can be used in a call expression.
A call expression that uses the name of a type is called a *type call
expression*. Only class type can be callable. To make a type
callable, a static method with the name ``$_invoke`` or ``$_instantiate`` must
be defined or inherited:

.. code-block-meta:

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    class C {
        static $_invoke() { console.log("invoked") }
    }
    C() // prints: invoked
    C.$_invoke() // also prints: invoked

In the above example, ``C()`` is a *type call expression*. It is the short
form of the normal method call ``C.$_invoke()``. Using an explicit call is
always valid for the methods ``$_invoke`` and ``$_instantiate``.

.. index::
   callable type
   call expression
   type name

   callable type
   class type
   type call expression
   method call
   inheritance
   static method
   normal method call
   call
   explicit call
   method

.. note::
   Only a constructor---not the methods ``$_invoke`` or ``$_instantiate``---is
   called in a *new expression*:

   .. code-block-meta:

   .. code-block:: typescript
      :linenos:

       class C {
           static $_invoke() { console.log("invoked") }
           constructor() { console.log("constructed") }
       }
       let x = new C() // constructor is called

The methods ``$_invoke`` and ``$_instantiate`` are similar but have differences
as discussed below.

A :index:`compile-time error` occurs if a callable type contains both methods
``invoke`` and ``$_instantiate``.

.. index::
   constructor
   method
   instantiation

.. _Callable Types with $_invoke Method:

Callable Types with ``$_invoke`` Method
=======================================

.. meta:
    frontend_status: Done

The static method ``$_invoke`` can have an arbitrary signature. The method
can be used in a *type call expression* in either case above. If the signature
has parameters, then the call must contain corresponding arguments.

.. code-block-meta:

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    class Add {
        static $_invoke(a: number, b: number): number {
            return a + b
        }
    }
    console.log(Add(2, 2)) // prints: 4

   invocation
   callable type
   arbitrary signature

That a type contains the instance method ``$_invoke`` does not make the type
*callable*.

.. _Callable Types with $_instantiate Method:

Callable Types with ``$_instantiate`` Method
============================================

.. meta:
    frontend_status: Done

The static method ``$_instantiate`` can have an arbitrary signature by itself.
If it is to be used in a *type call expression*, then its first parameter
must be a ``factory`` (i.e., it must be a *parameterless function type
returning some class type*).
The method can have or not have other parameters, and those parameters can
be arbitrary.

In a *type call expression*, the argument corresponding to the ``factory``
parameter is passed implicitly:

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    class C {
        static $_instantiate(factory: () => C): C {
            return factory()
        }
    }
    let x = C() // factory is passed implicitly

    // Explicit call of '$_instantiate' requires explicit 'factory':
    let y = C.$_instantiate(() => { return new C()})

.. index::
   static method
   callable type
   method
   instantiation
   signature
   arbitrary signature
   type call expression
   parameter
   factory parameter
   parameterless function type
   class type
   type call expression

If the method ``$_instantiate`` has additional parameters, then the call must
contain corresponding arguments:

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    class C {
        name = ""
        static $_instantiate(factory: () => C, name: string): C {
            let x = factory()
            x.name = name
            return x
        }
    }
    let x = C("Bob") // factory is passed implicitly

A :index:`compile-time error` occurs in a *type call expression* with type ``T``,
if:

- ``T`` has neither method ``$_invoke`` nor  method ``$_instantiate``; or
- ``T`` has the method ``$_instantiate`` but its first parameter is not
  a ``factory``.


.. code-block-meta:
    expect-cte

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    class C {
        static $_instantiate(factory: string): C {
            return factory()
        }
    }
    let x = C() // compile-time error, wrong '$_instantiate' 1st parameter

That a type contains the instance method ``$_instantiate`` does not make the
type *callable*.

An explicit type annotation is allowed for a *ForVariable*
(see :ref:`For-Of Statements`):

.. _Explicit Overload Declarations:

Explicit Overload Declarations
******************************

.. meta:
    frontend_status: None

|LANG| supports conventional overloading for functions, methods, and
constructors (i.e. implicit overloading of same-name entities), and an
innovative form of explicit overload declarations that allows
a developer to specify a set of overloaded entities explicitly and to control
the overload resolution process.

Regardless of implicit or explicit overloading being used, the actual entity
to be called is determined at compile time. As a result, *overloading* is
related to *compile-time polymorphism by name*. The semantic details are
discussed in :ref:`Overloading`.

.. index::
    polymorphism
    polymorphism by name
    entity
    overloading
    overloaded entity
    compile time
    compatibility
    semantics

An *explicit overload declaration* can be used for:

- Functions (see :ref:`Explicit Function Overload`), including functions in
  namespaces;
- Class or interface methods (see :ref:`Explicit Class Method Overload` and
  :ref:`Explicit Interface Method Overload`); and
- :ref:`Explicit Constructor Overload`.

An *overload declaration* starts with the keyword ``overload`` and
declares an *ordered overload set*. The exact syntax of the declaration
is presented in the appropriate subsections.

.. index::
    overload declaration
    overloaded entity
    entity
    function
    method
    constructor
    overload declaration
    namespace
    class method
    interface method
    method declaration
    overload keyword
    overload set
    entity

The use of an explicit overload declaration is represented in the example below:

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    function max2(a: number, b: number): number {
        return  a > b ? a : b
    }
    function maxN(...a: number[]): number {
        // return max element
    }

    // declare 'max' as an ordered set of functions max2 and maxN
    overload max { max2, maxN }

    max(1, 2)     // max2 is called
    max(3, 2, 4)  // maxN is called
    max("a", "b") // compile-time error, no function to call

The semantics of an entity included into an *overload set* does not change.
Such entities follow the ordinary accessibility rules, and can be called
explicitly as follows:

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    maxN(1, 2) // maxN is explicitly called
    max2(2, 3) // max2 is explicitly called

When calling an *explicit overload*, entities from an *overload set* are checked
in the listed order, and the first entity with an appropriate signature is
called (see :ref:`Overload resolution` for detail).
A :index:`compile-time error` occurs if no entity with an appropriate signature
is available:

.. index::
    function
    semantics
    entity
    overload
    accessibility
    overload set
    overload resolution
    signature

.. code-block-meta:
    expect-cte

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    max(1)    // maxN is called
    max(1, 2) // max2 is called, as is the first appropriate in the set

    max("a", "b") // compile-time error, no function to call

A name in an *overload set* can be the name of an implicitly overloaded entity.
In this case, :ref:`Overload Resolution` checks each implicitly overloaded
entity for this name, and not a single entity only. The implicitly overloaded
entities are checked in the order of declaration.

The use of a combination of explicit and implicit overloads is represented
in the example below:

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    // Implicitly overloaded functions:
    function minimum(a: number, b: number): number {/*body*/}
    function minimum(...a: number[]): number {/*body*/}

    // Function with the distinct name:
    function minInt(a: int, b: int): int {/*body*/}

    // overload set contains 'minInt' and two functions named 'minimum'
    overload min {minInt, minimum}

    // Overload resolution selects first appropriate function:
    min(1, 2)    // minInt is called
    min(3.14, 2) // min(a: number, b: number) is called
    min(1, 2, 3) // min(...a: number[]) is called

An overloaded entity in an *explicit overload declaration* can be *generic*
(see :ref:`Generics`).

If type arguments are provided explicitly in a call of an overloaded entity
(see :ref:`Explicit Generic Instantiations`), then only the entities that have
the number of type arguments compatible with the number of mandatory and
optional type parameters (i.e., entities with optional type parameters are the
entities that have type parameter default) are considered during
:ref:`Overload Resolution`:

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    // Resolution with explicit type arguments
    function one<T>() { console.log("one") }
    function two<T, U=string>() { console.log("two") }
    function three<T, U=string, V=number>() { console.log("three") }

    overload numbers { one, two, three }

    numbers<string, number, int>() // Only 'three` considered

    numbers<string, number>() // 'two' and 'three; considered as both
                              // allow 2 type arguments

    numbers<int>()  // 'one', 'two' and 'three; considered as all
                    // allow 1 type argument


If *type arguments* are not provided explicitly (see
:ref:`Implicit Generic Instantiations`), then consideration is given to all
entities as represented in the example below:

.. index::
    entity
    call
    call site
    function call
    overloaded entity
    overload declaration
    generic
    generic instantiation
    type argument
    type parameter
    overload resolution

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    function foo1(s: string) {}
    function foo2<T>(x: T) {}

    overload foo { foo1, foo2 }

    foo("aa")   // foo1 is called
    foo(1) // foo2 is called, implicit generic instantiation
    foo<string>("aa") // foo2 is called

An entity can be listed in several *explicit overload declarations*:

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    function max2i(a: int, b: int): int {
        return  a > b ? a : b
    }
    function maxNi(...a: int[]): int {
        // return max element
    }
    function maxN(...a: number[]): number {
        // return max element
    }

    overload maxi { max2i, maxNi }
    overload max { max2i, maxNi, maxN }

.. _Explicit Function Overload:

Explicit Function Overload
==============================

.. meta:
    frontend_status: None

*Explicit function overload* allows declaring a name for a set of functions
(see :ref:`Function Declarations`). The syntax is presented below:

.. code-block:: abnf

    explicitFunctionOverload:
        'overload' identifier overloadList
        ;
    overloadList:
        '{' identifier (',' identifier)* ','? '}'
        ;

.. index::
    explicit function overload
    set of functions
    function declaration
    function
    syntax
    qualified name

A :index:`compile-time error` occurs if an *identifier* in the list refers
to no accessible function.

All overloaded functions must be in the same module or namespace scope (see
:ref:`Scopes`). Otherwise, a :index:`compile-time error` occurs. The erroneous
overload declarations are represented in the example below:

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    import {foo1} from "something"

    function foo2() {}
    overload foo {foo1, foo2} // compile-time error

    namespace N {
        export function fooN() {}
        namespace M {
            export function fooM() {}
        }
        overload goo {M.fooM, fooN} // compile-time error
    }
    overload bar {foo2, N.fooN} // compile-time error

.. index::
    overloaded function
    module
    namespace
    namespace scope
    scope
    overload declaration
    import

A name of an *explicit function overload* can be the same as the name of a
function or implicitly overloaded functions in the same scope,
but the name must be used in the overloaded list, otherwise
a :index:`compile-time` occurs.
This situation is represented in the following example:

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    function foo(n: number): number {/*body1*/}
    function fooString(s: number): string {/*body2*/}

    overload foo {foo, fooString} // valid overload

    foo(1)    // function 'foo' is called
    foo("aa") // function 'fooString' is called

    function bar(): void {}

    // Invalid overload, as 'bar' does not appear in the list:
    overload bar {foo, fooString} // compile-time error

    let name: string = "abc"

    // Invalid overload, as 'name' refers to a variable:
    overload name {foo, fooString, name} // compile-time error

Using the name of a function as the name of an explicit overload causes no
ambiguity for it is considered at the call site only, i.e., a name of an
*explicit overload* is **not** considered in the following situations:

- List of the overloaded entities;

- :ref:`Function Reference`.

.. index::
    name
    overloaded function
    function
    entity
    function reference

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    function foo(n: number): number {/*body1*/}
    function fooString(s: number): string {/*body2*/}
    overload foo {foo, fooString}

    let func1 = foo // 'foo' refers to function, not to explicit overload

A :index:`compile-time error` occurs, if an *explicit overload* is exported
but an overloaded function is not:

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    export function foo1(p: string) {}
    function foo2(p: number) {}
    export overload foo { foo1, foo2 } // compile-time error, 'foo2' is not exported
    overload bar { foo1, foo2 } // ok, as 'bar' is not exported

If an *explicit overload* is called like a function with receiver, i.e., syntax
of method call is used (see :ref:`Functions with Receiver`), then a
:index:`compile-time error` occurs:

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    function bar1(this: string) {}
    function bar2(this: number) {}

    overload bar { bar1, bar2 }

    let s: string = "";
    let n: number = 1;

    bar(s) // OK
    bar(n) // OK
    s.bar()  // compile-time error
    n.bar()  // compile-time error

|

.. _Explicit Class Method Overload:

Explicit Class Method Overload
==================================

.. meta:
    frontend_status: None

*Explicit class method overload* allows declaring a name
for a set of class methods (see :ref:`Method Declarations`).
The syntax is presented below:

.. code-block:: abnf

    explicitClassMethodOverload:
        explicitClassMethodOverloadModifier*
        'overload' identifier overloadList
        ;

    explicitClassMethodOverloadModifier: 'static' | 'async';

The use of an *explicit class method overload* is represented in the example
below:

.. index::
    class method
    class member
    static method
    instance method
    method
    explicit class method overload
    syntax
    set of methods
    identifier

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    class Processor {
        overload process { processNumber, processString }
        processNumber(n: number) {/*body*/}
        processString(s: string) {/*body*/}
    }

    let c = new C()
    c.process(42) // calls processNumber
    c.process("aa") // calls processString

The name of an *explicit method overload* can be the same as the name of a
method in the same class (see :ref:`Explicit Overload Name Same As Method Name`
for details).

*Static explicit overload* is represented in the example below:

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    class C {
        static one(n: number) {/*body*/}
        static two(s: string) {/*body*/}
        static overload foo { one, two }
    }

A :index:`compile-time error` occurs if:

-  Method modifier is used more than once in an explicit method overload;

-  *Identifier* in the overloaded method list refers to no accessible
   method (either declared or inherited) of the current class;

-  *Explicit overload* is:

    - *Static* but the overloaded method is *non-static*;
    - *Non-static* but the overloaded method is *static*;
    - Marked ``async`` but the overloaded method is not; or
    - Not ``async`` but the overloaded method is.


.. index::
    method modifier
    explicit method overload
    identifier
    accessible method
    declaration
    inheritance
    overloaded method

An *explicit overload* and the overloaded methods can have different access
modifiers. A :index:`compile-time error` occurs if an *explicit overload* is:

-  ``public`` but at least one overloaded method is not ``public``;

-  ``protected`` but at least one overloaded method is ``private``.


Valid and invalid explicit overloads are represented in the example below:

.. index::
    overloaded method
    explicit overload
    access modifier
    public
    protected
    private

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    class C {
        private foo1(x: number) {/*body*/}
        protected foo2(x: string) {/*body*/}
        public foo3(x: boolean) {/*body*/}
        foo4() {/*body*/} // implicitly public

        public overload foo { foo3, foo4 } // ok
        protected overload bar { foo2, foo3 } // ok
        private overload goo { foo1, foo2, foo3 } // ok

        public overload err1 {foo2, foo3} // compile-time error, foo2 is not public
        protected overload err2 {foo2, foo1} // compile-time error, foo1 is private
    }

Some or all overloaded functions can be ``native`` as follows:

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    class C {
        native foo1(x: number)
        foo2(x: string) {/*body*/}
        overload foo { foo1, foo2 }
    }

.. index::
    public
    overload
    private
    overloaded function
    native

If a superclass has an *explicit overload*, then this declaration can be
overridden in a subclass. If a subclass does not override an
*explicit overload*, then the overload from the superclass is inherited.

If a subclass overrides an *explicit overload*, then this declaration must
list all methods of the *explicit overload* in a superclass, otherwise, a
:index:`compile-time error` occurs.

In addition, overriding an *explicit overload* in a subclass can include
new methods and change the order of methods.

An *explicit overload* is used like an ordinary class method except that it is
replaced in a call at compile time for one of overloaded methods that use the
type of *object reference*. An *explicit overload* in subtypes is
represented in the example below:

.. index::
    superclass
    overload declaration
    overriding
    subclass
    inheritance
    declaration
    superclass
    overloaded method
    object reference
    method

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    class Base {
        overload process { processNumber, processString }
        processNumber(n: number) {/*body*/}
        processString(s: string) {/*body*/}
    }

    class D1 extends Base {
        // method is overridden
        override processNumber(n: number) {/*body*/}
        // overload declaration is inherited
    }

    class D2 extends Base {
        // method is added:
        processInt(n: int) {/*body*/}
        // new order for overloaded methods is specified:
        overload process { processInt, processNumber, processString }
    }

    new D1().process(1)   // calls processNumber from D1

    new D2().process(1)   // calls processInt from D2 (as it is listed earlier)
    new D2().process(1.0) // calls processNumber from Base (first appropriate)

Methods with special names (see :ref:`Indexable Types`, :ref:`Iterable Types`,
and :ref:`Callable Types`) can be overloaded like ordinary methods:

.. index::
    overloaded method
    overriding
    method
    name
    iterable type
    callable type
    inheritance
    ordinary method
    name

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    class C {
        getByNumber(n: number): string {...}
        getByString(s: string): string {...}
        overload $_get { getByNumber, getByString }
    }

    let c = new C()

    c[1]     // getByNumber is used
    c["abc"] // getByString is used

If a class implements some interfaces with an *explicit overload* of the
same name, then a new *explicit overload* must include all overloaded
methods. Otherwise, a :index:`compile-time error` occurs.

.. index::
    overloaded method
    class
    interface
    overload declaration
    alias

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    interface I1 {
        overload foo {f1, f2}
        // f1 and f2 are declared in I1
    }
    interface I2 {
        overload foo {f3, f4}
        // f3 and f4 are declared in I2
    }
    class C implements I1, I2 {
       // compile-time error as no new overload is defined
    }
    class D implements I1, I2 {
        overload foo { f2, f3, f1, f4 } // OK, as new overload is defined
    }
    class E implements I1, I2 {
        overload foo { f2, f4 } // compile-time error as not all methods are used
    }

    const i1: I1 = new D
    i1.foo(<arguments>) // call is valid if arguments fit first signature of {f1, f2} set

    const i2: I2 = new D
    i2.foo(<arguments>) // call is valid if arguments fit first signature of {f3, f4} set

    const d: D = new D
    d.foo(<arguments>) // call is valid if arguments fit first signature of {f2, f3, f1, f4} set

.. index::
    overloaded interface
    declaration
    method
    argument
    signature

.. _Explicit Interface Method Overload:

Explicit Interface Method Overload
======================================

.. meta:
    frontend_status: None

*Explicit interface method overload* allows declaring a name
for a set of interface methods (see :ref:`Interface Method Declarations`).
The syntax is presented below:

.. code-block:: abnf

    explicitInterfaceMethodOverload:
        'overload' identifier overloadList
        ;

The use of an *explicit interface method overload* is represented in the
example below:

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    interface I {
        foo(): void
        bar(n?: string): void
        overload goo { foo, bar }
    }

    function example(i: I) {
        i.goo()        // calls i.foo()
        i.goo("hello") // calls i.bar("hello")
        i.bar()        // explicit call: i.bar(undefined)
    }

.. index::
    interface method
    explicit overload
    interface

The name of an *explicit method overload* can be the same as the name of a
method in the same interface (see
:ref:`Explicit Overload Name Same As Method Name` for details).

An *explicit overload* is used like an ordinary interface method, except that
one of the overloaded methods replaces it in a call at compile time by using
the type of *object reference*.

An *explicit interface overload* can be overridden in a class. In that case,
an *explicit overload* in a class must contain all the methods overloaded in the
interface. Otherwise, a :index:`compile-time error` occurs.

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

   class D implements I {
        foo(): void {/*body*/}
        bar(n?: string): void {/*body*/}
        overload goo( bar, foo) // order is changes
   }

   let d = new D()
   d.goo() // d.bar(undefined) is used, as it is the first appropriate method

If a class does not override an *explicit overload* declared in an interface,
then it inherits the overload:

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

   // Using interface overload declaration
   class C implements I {
        foo(): void {/*body*/}
        bar(n?: string): void {/*body*/}
   }

   let c = new C()
   c.goo() // calls c.foo()

.. index::
    ordinary method
    interface method
    call
    compile time
    overloaded method
    object reference
    type
    class
    implementation

An *explicit overload* defined in a superinterface can be overridden in a
subinterface. In this case, the *overload declaration* of the subinterface
must contain all methods overloaded in superinterface. Otherwise, a
:index:`compile-time error` occurs.

An *explicit overload* defined in a superinterface must be overridden in a
subinterface if several *explicit overloads* of the same name are inherited
in the interface. Otherwise, a :index:`compile-time error` occurs.

.. index::
    interface
    class
    explicit overload
    superinterface
    method
    subinterface
    overloaded method
    interface
    override
    inheritance

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    interface I1 {
        overload foo {f1, f2}
        // f1 and f2 are declared in I1
    }
    interface I2 {
        overload foo {f3, f4}
        // f3 and f4 are declared in I2
    }
    interface I3 extends I1, I2 {
       // compile-time error as no new overload for 'foo' is defined
    }
    interface I4 extends I1, I2 {
        overload foo { f4, f1, f3, f2 } // OK, as new overload is defined
    }
    interface I5 extends I1, I2 {
        overload foo { f1, f3 } // compile-time error as not all methods are included
    }

.. _Explicit Overload Name Same As Method Name:

Explicit Overload Name Same As Method Name
==========================================

.. meta:
    frontend_status: None

The name of an *explicit overload* of a class or an interface can be the same
as the name of the overloaded method. For example, a method defined in a
superclass can be used as one of the overloaded methods in an *explicit
overload* of the same-name subclass. This important case is represented in the
following example:

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    class C {
        foo(n: number): number {/*body*/}
    }
    class D implements C {
        fooString(s: number): string {/*body*/}

        overload foo {
            foo, // method 'foo' from C
            fooString
        }
    }

    let d = new D()
    let c: C = d

    d.foo(1)    // 'foo' from C is called
    d.foo("aa") // 'fooString' from D is called
    c.foo(1)    // method 'foo' from is called (no overload)

.. index::
    method name
    explicit overload
    overloaded method
    superclass
    subclass

If names of a method and of an *explicit overload* are the same, then the method
can be overridden as usual:

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    class C {
        foo(n: number): number {/*body*/}
    }
    class D implements C {
        foo(n: number): number {/*body*/} // method is overridden
        fooString(s: number): string {/*body*/}

        overload foo { foo, fooString }
    }

This feature is also valid in interfaces, or in an interface and a class that
implements the interface:

.. index::
    method
    name
    method name
    overriding
    overridden method
    interface
    class
    implementation

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    interface I {
        foo(n: number): number {/*body*/}
    }
    interface J extends I {
        fooString(s: number): string
        overload foo { foo, fooString }
    }

    class K implements I {
        foo(n: number): number {/*body*/}
        fooString(s: number): string {/*body*/}

        overload foo { foo, fooString }
    }

The use of an *explicit overload* causes no ambiguity for it is considered
at the call site only. An *explicit overload*  name is **not** considered
in the following situations:

- :ref:`Overriding`;

- List of the overloaded entities (see :ref:`Explicit Class Method Overload`
  and :ref:`Explicit Interface Method Overload`);

- :ref:`Method Reference`.

.. index::
    number
    interface
    string
    overload
    call site
    overriding
    overloaded entity
    method reference
    class method overload declaration
    method reference

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    class C {
        foo(n: number): number {/*body*/}
    }

    class D implements C {
        fooString(s: number): string {/*body*/}

        overload foo { foo, fooString }
    }

    let d = new D()
    let c: C = d

    let func1 = c.foo // method 'foo' is used
    let func2 = d.foo // method 'foo' is used

A :index:`compile-time error` occurs if the name of an *explicit overload*
is the same as the name of a method (with the same static or non-static
modifier) that is not listed as an overloaded method as follows:

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    class C {
        foo(n: number) {/*body*/}
        fooString(s: number) {/*body*/}
        fooBoolean(b: boolean) {/*body*/}

        overload foo { // compile-time error
            fooBoolean, fooString
        }
    }

.. index::
    number
    string

.. _Explicit Constructor Overload:

Explicit Constructor Overload
=================================

.. meta:
    frontend_status: None

*Explicit constructor overload* allows setting an order of constructors
for a call in a new expression. The syntax is presented below:

.. code-block:: abnf

    explicitConstructorOverload:
        'overload' 'constructor' overloadList
        ;

This feature can be used if a class has one or more named constructors (see
:ref:`Named Constructors`).

Only a single *explicit constructor overload* is allowed in a class.
Otherwise, a :index:`compile-time error` occurs.

*Explicit overload* for constructors is used in the same manner as a
normal constructor is (see :ref:`New Expressions`).

The use of an *explicit constructor overload* is represented in the example
below:

.. index::
    constructor
    explicit constructor overload
    syntax
    declaration
    constructor
    call
    class
    name

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    class BigFloat {
        constructor fromNumber(n: number) {/*body1*/}
        constructor fromString(s: string) {/*body2*/}

        overload constructor { fromNumber, fromString }
    }

    new BigFloat(1)      // fromNumber is used
    new BigFloat("3.14") // fromString is used


If a class has an anonymous constructor, then it is implicitly placed at the
first position in the list of the overloaded constructors:

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    class C {
        constructor () {/*body*/}
        constructor fromString(s?: string) {/*body*/}

        overload constructor { fromString }
    }

    new C()                // anonymous constructor is used
    new C("abc")           // fromString is used
    new C.fromString("aa") // fromString is explicitly used

A class can be declared ``final`` to prevent extension, i.e., a class declared
``final`` can have no subclasses. No method of a ``final`` class can be
overridden.

If a class type ``F`` expression is declared *final*, then only a class ``F``

   .. meta:
   frontend_status: None
   A class can be declared ``sealed`` to prevent an extension outside of the
   current module or namespace, i.e., a class declared ``sealed`` can have
   subclasses only within its module or namespace. It limits the number of
   subclasses to subclasses defined within the same module or namespace.
   A ``sealed`` class is ``final`` outside of its module or namespace.
   A :index:`compile-time error` occurs if the ``extends`` clause of a class
   declaration outside of the current module or namespace contains another class
   that is ``sealed``.
   .. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:
   // File1
   export sealed class A{}

.. _Named Constructors:

Named Constructors
==================

.. meta:
    frontend_status: None

A :ref:`Constructor Declaration` allows a developer to set a name used to
explicitly specify constructor to call in :ref:`New Expressions`:

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    class Temperature{
        // use specified scale:
        constructor Celsius(n: double)    {/*body1*/}
        constructor Fahrenheit(n: double) {/*body2*/}
    }

    new Temperature.Celsius(0)
    new Temperature.Fahrenheit(32)

If a constructor has a name, then using the constructor directly in a new
expression implies using the constructor name explicitly:

.. index::
   constructor name
   constructor declaration
   constructor
   expression
   name

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    class X{
        constructor ctor1(p: number) {/*body1*/}
        constructor ctor2(p: string) {/*body2*/}
    }

    new X(1)      // compile-time error
    new X("abs")  // compile-time error
    new X.ctor1(1)      // OK
    new X.ctor2("abs")  // OK

A :index:`compile-time error` occurs if a constructor name is the same
as other constructor name. In other words, *implicit overloading* of
named constructors is forbidden.

A :index:`compile-time error` occurs if a constructor name is used as a named
reference (see :ref:`Named Reference`) in any expression.

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    class X{

**************************************

.. meta:

|LANG| supports adding functions and accessors to already defined types. The
usage of functions so added looks the same as if they are methods and accessors
of such types. The mechanism is called :ref:`Functions with Receiver`
and :ref:`Accessors with Receiver`. This feature is often used to add new
functionality to a class or an interface without having to inherit from the
class or to implement the interface. However, it can be used not only for
classes and interfaces but also for other types.

Moreover, :ref:`Function Types with Receiver` and
:ref:`Lambda Expressions with Receiver` can be defined and used to make the
code more flexible.

.. _Functions with Receiver:

Functions with Receiver
=======================

.. meta:
    frontend_status: Done

*Function with receiver* declaration is a top-level declaration
(see :ref:`Top-Level Declarations`) that looks almost the same as
:ref:`Function Declarations`, except that the first mandatory parameter uses
keyword ``this`` as its name.

The syntax of *function with receiver* is presented below:

.. code-block:: abnf

    functionWithReceiverDeclaration:
        'function' identifier typeParameters? signatureWithReceiver block
        ;

    signatureWithReceiver:
        '(' receiverParameter (', ' parameterList)? ')' returnType?
        ;

    receiverParameter:

        ;

.. index::
   function with receiver
   function with receiver declaration
   declaration
   top-level declaration
   function declaration
   parameter
   this keyword

*Function with receiver* can be called in the following two ways by making:

-  Ordinary function call (see :ref:`Function Call Expression`) when the first
   argument is the receiver object;

-  Method call (see :ref:`Method Call Expression`) when the receiver is an
   ``objectReference`` before the function name passed as the first argument
   of the call.

All other arguments are handled in an ordinary manner.

.. index::
   function with receiver
   function call
   expression
   parameter
   method call
   method call expression
   derived class
   derived interface
   argument
   object reference
   receiver
   function name

.. note::
   Derived classes or interfaces can be used as receivers.

   .. code-block:: typescript
      :linenos:

         class C {}

         function foo(this: C) {}
         function bar(this: C, n: number): void {}

         let c = new C()

         // as a function call:
         foo(c)
         bar(c, 1)

         // as a method call:
         c.foo()
         c.bar(1)

         interface D {}
         function foo1(this: D) {}
         function bar1(this: D, n: number): void {}

         function demo (d: D) {
            // as a function call:
            foo1(d)
            bar1(d, 1)

            // as a method call:
            d.foo1()
            d.bar1(1)
         }

         class E implements D {}
         const e = new E

         // derived class is used as a receiver for a method call:
         e.foo1()
         e.bar1(1)

         // the same as a function call:
         foo1(e)
         bar1(e, 1)


The keyword ``this`` must be used in the parameter list for the first parameter
only. If it is used for other parameters, then a :index:`compile-time error`
occurs. The keyword ``this`` can be used inside a *function with receiver* where
it corresponds to the first parameter. The type of parameter ``this`` is called
*receiver type* (see :ref:`Receiver Type`):

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

      class A {
        num: number = 1
        foo(): void { console.log(this.num); }
      }
      function bar(this: A) {
        this.num = 5
      }
      let a = new A()
      a.foo() // method is called
      a.bar() // Function with receiver is called
      a.foo() // method is called

If the *receiver type* is a class or interface type, then ``private`` or
``protected`` members are not accessible (see :ref:`Accessible`) within the
body of a *function with receiver*. Only ``public`` members can be accessed:

.. index::
   this keyword
   function with receiver
   receiver type
   type parameter
   call
   interface type
   public member
   private member
   protected member
   access
   accessibility
   parameter

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

      class A {
          foo () { ... this.bar() ... }
                       // function bar() is accessible here
          protected member_1 ...
          private member_2 ...
      }
      function bar(this: A) { ...
         this.foo() // Method foo() is accessible as it is public
         this.member_1 // Compile-time error as member_1 is not accessible
         this.member_2 // Compile-time error as member_2 is not accessible
         ...
      }
      let a = new A()
      a.foo() // Ordinary class method is called
      a.bar() // Function with receiver is called

*Function with receiver* can be generic as in the following example:

.. index::
   function with receiver
   access
   accessibility
   instance method
   derived class
   name
   method
   receiver type
   generic function

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

     function foo<T>(this: B<T>, p: T) {
          console.log (p)
     }
     function demo (p1: B<SomeClass>, p2: B<BaseClass>) {
         p1.foo(new SomeClass())
           // Type inference should determine the instantiating type
         p2.foo<BaseClass>(new DerivedClass())
          // Explicit instantiation
     }

A :index:`compile-time error` occurs if the name of a *function with receiver*
(including generic functions) and the name of an accessible instance method or
field of the receiver type (see :ref:`Accessible`) are the same:

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

      class A {
          foo () { ... }
          bar(): A { return this; }
      }

      // Compile-time error to prevent ambiguity below
      function foo(this: A) { ... }

      // Compile-time error to prevent ambiguity below
      function bar<T extends Object>(this : T) : T { return this }

      (new A).foo()
      (new A).bar()


*Functions with receiver* are dispatched statically. What function is being
called is known at compile time based on the receiver type specified in the
declaration. A *function with receiver* can be applied to the receiver of any
derived class until it is overridden within the derived class:

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

      class Base { ... }
      class Derived extends Base { ... }

      function foo(this: Base) { console.log ("Base.foo is called") }

      let b: Base = new Base()
      b.foo() // `Base.foo is called` to be printed
      b = new Derived()
      b.foo() // `Base.foo is called` to be printed

A *function with receiver* can be defined in a module other than the one that
defines the receiver type. This is represented in the following example:

.. index::
   function with receiver
   static dispatch
   function call
   compile time
   receiver type
   declaration
   receiver
   derived class
   class
   module

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

      // file a.ets
      class A {
          foo() { ... }
      }

      // file ext.ets
      import {A} from "a.ets" // name 'A' is imported
      function bar(this: A) () {
         this.foo() // Method foo() is called
      }

A *function with receiver* can be defined in a namespace (see
:ref:`Namespace Declarations`). A *function with receiver* cannot be called by
using the *method call* syntax outside the namespace, though, because an entity
exported from a namespace can be accessed in the form of a ``qualifiedName``
only.

This situation is represented in the following example:

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    namespace NS {
        export function foo(this: int) {}
        function bar(i: int) {
            i.foo() // ok, method call is used
        }
    }

    let i = 1
    NS.foo(i)  // ok, function call is used
    i.foo()    // compile-time error: 'foo' is not resolved
    i.NS.foo() // compile-time error: 'NS' is not defined for 'int'

.. note::
    While a function with receiver can be used in an explicit overload list,
    such an overload cannot be called by using the method access syntax as
    in the example provided in :ref:`Explicit Function Overload`.

.. _Receiver Type:

Receiver Type
=============

.. meta:
    frontend_status: Done

*Receiver type* is the type of the *receiver parameter* in a function,
function type, and lambda with receiver.

Using array type as a *receiver type* is presented in the example below:

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

      function addElements(this: number[], ...s: number[]) {
       ...
      }

      let x: number[] = [1, 2]
      x.addElements(3, 4)

The use of union type as *receiver type* is presented in the example below:

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

      function process_union(this: number | string) {
          console.log (this)
      }

      (5).process_union ()
      ("555").process_union ()
      process_union (5)
      process_union ("555")


.. index::

.. _Accessors with Receiver:

Accessors with Receiver
=======================

.. meta:
    frontend_status: Done

.. note::
   Accessor declarations at the top level or in namespaces are of the following
   two kinds:

       - *Accessors with Receiver* (as described in this subsection)
         that can be used much like fields of a class; and
       - Ordinary :ref:`Accessor Declarations` that can be used to replace
         variables.

*Accessor with receiver* declaration is either a top-level declaration
(see :ref:`Top-Level Declarations`), or a declaration inside a namespace
(see :ref:`Namespace Declarations`) that can be used as class
(see :ref:`Class Accessor Declarations`) or interface accessor
(see :ref:`Interface Properties`) for a specified receiver type:

The syntax of *accessor with receiver* is presented below:

.. code-block:: abnf

    accessorWithReceiverDeclaration:
          'get' identifier '(' receiverParameter ')' returnType block
        | 'set' identifier '(' receiverParameter ',' requiredParameter ')' block
        ;

The keyword ``this`` can be used inside a *function with receiver*. It
corresponds to the first parameter. Otherwise, a :index:`compile-time error`
occurs.
The type of parameter ``this`` is called the *receiver type* (see
:ref:`Receiver Type`).

If the *receiver type* is a class type or an interface type, then ``private``
or ``protected`` members are not accessible (see :ref:`Accessible`) within the
body of a *function with receiver*. Only ``public`` members can be accessed:

A get-accessor (getter) must have the keyword ``this`` as the only getter
parameter (*receiverParameter*) and an explicit return type.

A set-accessor (setter) must have a keyword ``this`` as a first setter parameter
(*receiver parameter*), one other parameter, and no return type.

The keyword ``this`` has the same meaning and can be used in the same manner
as described in :ref:`Functions with Receiver`:

- The keyword ``this`` can be used inside an *accessor with receiver*. It
  corresponds to the first parameter. Otherwise, a :index:`compile-time error`
  occurs.

- The type of parameter ``this`` is called the *receiver type* (see
  :ref:`Receiver Type`).

- If the *receiver type* is a class or interface type, then ``private`` or
  ``protected`` members are not accessible (see :ref:`Accessible`) within the
  body of a *function with receiver*. Only ``public`` members can be accessed.

.. note::
   If the *accessor with receiver* is an entity of a namespace, then the same
   rules apply to it when exporting and using qualified names as the rules that
   apply to other namespace entities (see :ref:`Namespace Declarations`).

The use of getters and setters looks identical to the use of fields:

.. index::
   accessor with receiver
   accessor with receiver declaration
   receiver type
   syntax
   accessor declaration
   parameter
   top-level declaration
   get-accessor
   setter
   getter
   set-accessor
   receiver parameter
   return type
   field

.. code-block:: typescript
    :linenos:

    class Person {
        firstName: string
        lastName: string
        constructor (first: string, last: string) {
            this.firstName = first
            this.lastName = last
        }
    }

    get fullName(this: Person): string {
        return this.lastName + ' ' + this.firstName
    }

    let c = new Person("John", "Doe")

    // Getter - ok, top=level getter with receiver used
    console.log(c.fullName) // output: 'Doe John'

     // compile-time error, as setter is not defined
    c.fullName = "new name"

A :index:`compile-time error` occurs if an accessor is used in the form of
a function or a method call.

.. index::
   accessor
   function call
   method call
   string
   setter
   function

.. _Function Types with Receiver:

Function Types with Receiver
============================

.. meta:
    frontend_status: Done

*Function type with receiver* specifies the signature of a function or lambda
with receiver. It is almost the same as *function type* (see :ref:`Function Types`),
except that the first parameter is mandatory, and the keyword ``this`` is used
as its name:

The syntax of *function type with receiver* is presented below:

.. code-block:: abnf

    functionTypeWithReceiver:
        '(' receiverParameter (',' ftParameterList)? ')' ftReturnType
        ;

The type of a *receiver parameter* is called the *receiver type* (see
:ref:`Receiver Type`).

.. index::
   function type with receiver
   signature
   function
   lambda
   function with receiver
   lambda with receiver
   function type
   this keyword
   syntax
   parameter
   receiver type
   receiver parameter

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

      class A {...}

      type FA = (this: A) => boolean
      type FN = (this: number[], max: number) => number

*Function type with receiver* can be generic as in the following example:

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

      class B<T> {...}

      type FB<T> = (this: B<T>, x: T): void
      type FBS = (this: B<string>, x: string): void

The usual rule of function type compatibility (see
:ref:`Subtyping for Function Types`) is applied to
*function type with receiver*, and parameter names are ignored.

.. index::
   function type with receiver
   generic
   function type
   compatibility
   subtyping
   parameter name

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

      class A {...}

      type F1 = (this: A) => boolean
      type F2 = (a: A) => boolean

      function foo(this: A): boolean {}
      function goo(a: A): boolean {}

      let f1: F1 = foo // ok
      f1 = goo // ok

      let f2: F2 = goo // ok
      f2 = foo // ok
      f1 = f2 // ok

The sole difference is that only an entity of *function type with receiver*
nut not an entity of a compatible *function type* can be used in
:ref:`Method Call Expression`.

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

      let a = new A()
      a.f1() // ok, function type with receiver
      f1(a)  // ok

      a.f2() // compile-time error
      f2(a) // ok

.. index::
   entity
   function type with receiver
   method call
   expression
   compile-time error


.. note::
    The limitation of the method call syntax can be easily bypassed by assigning
    an ordinary function to a compatible *function type with receiver*.
    A snippet of code illustrative of parameter type with receiver is
    represented by the example below.

Function type with receiver can be used as a parameter type. Using parameter
type with receiver is represented by the example below:

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    function foo(p: number, f: (this: number)=> number) {
        console.log(p.f(), f(p))
    }

    function goo(this: number) { return this - 1 }
    function bar(this: number) { return this + 1 }
    function compat(n: number) { return n }

    let n: number = 1
    foo(n, goo)  // prints `0 0`
    foo(n, bar)  // prints `2 2`
    foo(n, compat)  // prints `1 1`


The method call syntax cannot be used when assigning the actual entity to a
variable of *function type with receiver*. Attempting to do so causes a
:index:`compile-time error`:

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

   function foo<T extends Object>(this: T, functor: (this: T)=> void): void {
      // following two calls are equivalent
      functor(this)
      this.functor()
   }

   function bar<T>(this: T): void {
      console.log(this)
   }

   let x = 5
   x.foo(bar<int>) // OK
   let y = bar<int> // ok
   x.foo(y) // ok

   // compile time error - can not assign entity with method call syntax
   // to a function type
   x.foo(x.bar)
   x.foo(x.bar<int>)
   let z = x.bar
   let y = x.bar<int>

|

.. _Lambda Expressions with Receiver:

Lambda Expressions with Receiver
================================

.. meta:
    frontend_status: Done

*Lambda expression with receiver* defines an instance of a *function type with
receiver* (see :ref:`Function Types with Receiver`). It looks almost the same
as an ordinary lambda expression (see :ref:`Lambda Expressions`), except that
the first parameter is mandatory, and the keyword ``this`` is used as its name:

The syntax of *lambda expression with receiver* is presented below:

.. code-block:: abnf

    lambdaExpressionWithReceiver:
        annotationUsage?
        '(' receiverParameter (',' lambdaParameterList)? ')'
        returnType? '=>' lambdaBody
        ;

The use of annotations is discussed in :ref:`Using Annotations`.

The keyword ``this`` can be used inside a *lambda expression with receiver*,
It corresponds to the first parameter:

.. index::
   lambda expression with receiver
   lambda expression
   instance
   function type with receiver
   lambda expression
   parameter
   this keyword
   annotation

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

      class A { name = "Bob" }

      let show = (this: A): void {
          console.log(this.name)
      }

Lambda can be called in two syntactical ways represented by the example below:

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

      class A {
        name: string
        constructor (n: string) {
            this.name = n
        }
      }

      function foo(aa: A[], f: (this: A) => void) {
        for (let a of aa) {
            a.f() // first way
            f (a) // second way
        }
      }

      let aa: A[] = [new A("aa"), new A("bb")]
      foo(aa, (this: A) => { console.log(this.name)} ) // output: "aa" "bb"

.. index::
   lambda
   syntax
   constructor
   function
   class

.. note::
   If *lambda expression with receiver* is declared in a class or interface,
   then ``this`` use in the lambda body refers to the first lambda parameter and
   not to the surrounding class or interface. Any lambda call outside a class
   has to use the ordinary syntax of arguments as represented by the example
   below:


   .. code-block:: typescript
      :linenos:

         class B {
           foo() { console.log ("foo() from B is called") }
         }
         class A {
           foo() { console.log ("foo() from A is called") }
           bar() {
               let lambda1 = (this: B): void => { this.foo() } // local lambda
               new B().lambda1()
           }
           lambda2 = (this: B): void => { this.foo() } // class field lambda
         }
         new A().bar() // Output is 'foo() from B is called'
         new A().lambda2 (new B) // Argument is to be provided in its usual place

         interface I {
            lambda: (this: B) => void // Property of the function type
         }
         function foo (i: I) {
            i.lambda(new B) // Argument is to be provided in its usual place
         }

.. _Implicit this in Lambda with Receiver Body:

Implicit ``this`` in Lambda with Receiver Body
==============================================

.. meta:
    frontend_status: None

Implicit ``this`` can be used in the body of *lambda expression with receiver*
when accessing the following:

- Instance methods, fields, and accessors of lambda receiver type (see
  :ref:`Receiver Type`); or
- Functions with receiver (see :ref:`Functions with Receiver`) of the same
  receiver type.

In other words, prefix ``this.`` in such cases can be omitted. This feature
is added to |LANG| to improve DSL support. It is represented in the following
examples:

.. index::
   lambda expression with receiver
   lambda with receiver body
   receiver body
   this
   lambda
   access
   accessor
   DSL support
   prefix
   instance
   method
   field
   lambda receiver type
   receiver type
   prefix

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

     class C {
       name: string = ""
       foo(): void {}
     }

     function process(context: (this: C) => void) {}

     process(
        (this: C): void => {
            this.foo()   // ok - normal call
            foo()        // ok - implicit 'this'
            name = "Bob" // ok - implicit 'this'
        }
     )

The same applies if *lambda expression with receiver* is defined as
*trailing lambda* (see :ref:`Trailing Lambdas`). In this case, lambda signature
is inferred from the context:

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

     process() {
        this.foo() // ok - normal call
        foo()      // ok - implicit 'this'
     }

The use of an implicit ``this`` when calling a *function with receiver* is
represented in the following example:

.. index::
   lambda expression with receiver
   trailing lambda
   lambda signature
   inference
   context
   call
   function with receiver

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

     function bar(this: C) {}
     function otherBar(this: OtherClass) {}

     process() {
        bar()      // ok -  implicit 'this'
        otherBar() // compile-time error, wrong type of implicit 'this'
     }

If a simple name used in a lambda body can be resolved as instance method,
field, or accessor of the receiver type, and as another entity in the current
scope at the same time, then a :index:`compile-time error` occurs to prevent
ambiguity and improve readability.

.. index::
   simple name
   lambda body
   instance method
   field
   accessor
   receiver type
   entity
   scope
   readability

.. _Trailing Lambdas:

Trailing Lambdas
****************

.. meta:
    frontend_status: Done

The *trailing lambda* is a special form of notation for function
or method call when the last parameter of a function or a method is of
function type, and the argument is passed as a lambda using the
:ref:`Block` notation. The *trailing lambda* syntactically looks as follows:

.. code-block:: abnf

    trailingLambda:
        block
        ;

.. index::
   trailing lambda
   notation
   function call
   method call
   parameter
   function type
   method
   parameter
   lambda
   block notation

The use of a trailing lambda is represented in the example below:

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

      class A {
          foo (f: ()=>void) { ... }
      }

      let a = new A()
      a.foo() { console.log ("method lambda argument is activated") }
      // method foo receives last argument as the trailing lambda

Currently, no parameter can be specified for the type of a trailing lambda,
except a receiver parameter (see :ref:`Lambda Expressions with Receiver`).
Otherwise, a :index:`compile-time error` occurs.

A block immediately after a call is always handled as *trailing lambda*.
A :index:`compile-time error` occurs if the last parameter of the called entity
is not of a function type.

The semicolon ``';'`` separator can be used between a call and a block to
indicate that the block does not define a *trailing lambda*. When calling an
entity with the last optional parameter (see :ref:`Optional Parameters`), it
means that the call must use the default value of the parameter.

.. index::
   trailing lambda
   syntax
   parameter
   receiver parameter
   optional parameter
   lambda expression with receiver
   block
   function type
   lambda
   semicolon
   separator
   default value
   call

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

      function foo (f: ()=>void) { ... }

      foo() { console.log ("trailing lambda") }
      // 'foo' receives last argument as the trailing lambda

      function bar(f?: ()=>void) { ... }

      bar() { console.log ("trailing lambda") }
      // function 'bar' receives last argument as the trailing lambda,
      bar(); { console.log ("that is the block code") }
      // function 'bar' is called with parameter 'f' set to 'undefined'

      function goo(n: number) { ... }

      goo() { console.log("aa") } // compile-time error as goo() requires an argument
      goo(); { console.log("aa") } // compile-time error as goo() requires an argument


If there are optional parameters in front of an optional function type parameter,
then calling such a function or method can skip optional arguments and keep the
trailing lambda only. This implies that the value of all skipped arguments is
``undefined``.

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    function foo (p1?: number, p2?: string, f?: ()=>string) {
        console.log (p1, p2, f?.())
    }

    foo()                           // undefined undefined undefined
    foo() { return "lambda" }       // undefined undefined lambda
    foo(1) { return "lambda" }      // 1 undefined lambda
    foo(1, "a") { return "lambda" } // 1 a lambda

.. _Accessor Declarations:

Accessor Declarations
*********************

.. meta:
    frontend_status: None

.. note::
   Accessor declarations at the top level or in namespaces are of the following
   two kinds:

       - :ref:`Accessors with Receiver` that can be used much like fields of
         a class; and
       - Ordinary *Accessor declarations* (as described in this subsection)
         that can be used to replace variables.

Accessor is either a top-level declaration (see
:ref:`Top-level Declarations`) or a declaration inside a namespace
(see :ref:`Namespace Declarations`) that can be used to replace a variable
and provide additional control in an operation of getting or setting a variable
value. An accessor can be either a getter or a setter.

The syntax of *accessor declarations* is presented below:

.. code-block:: abnf

    accessorDeclaration:
        'native'?
        ( 'get' identifier '(' ')' returnType? block?
        | 'set' identifier '(' requiredParameter ')' block?

The modifier ``native`` indicates that the accessor is a *native accessor*
(similarly to :ref:`Native Functions`).

A non-native accessor must have a body. A :index:`compile-time error` occurs if:

- Native accessor has a body; or
- Non-native accessor has no body.

A *get-accessor* (*getter*) must have an explicit return type and no parameters,
or no return type at all on condition the type can be inferred from the getter
body (see :ref:`Return Type Inference`).
A *set-accessor* (*setter*) must have a single parameter and no return type.

.. note::
   If an *accessor* is an entity of a namespace, then the same rules apply to
   it when exporting and using qualified names as the rules that apply to other
   namespace entities (see :ref:`Namespace Declarations`).

A :index:`compile-time error` occurs if:

-  Getter or setter is used in a call expression (like a function);
-  Getter return type cannot be inferred from the getter body; or
-  *Set-accessor* (*setter*) has an optional parameter (see
   :ref:`Optional Parameters`):

The typical use of an accessor to control value setting is represented in the
following example:

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    let saved_age = 0

    export get age(): number { return saved_age }
    export set age(a: number) {
        if (a < 0) { throw new Error("wrong age") }
        saved_age = a
    }

A getter and a setter, unlike functions, can have the same name for they are
distinguishable by the place of use:

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

   let _name = ""
   get name(): string { return _name }
   set name(x: string) { _name = x }

.. index::
   accessor
   value setting
   control
   getter
   setter
   function

However, an accessor declaration must be distinguishable from other entities,
and a :index:`compile-time error` occurs if:

- Accessor name is the same as that of another entity in a scope;
- Names of two getters or two setters in a scope are the same.

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

   let name = "Bob"
   get name(): string { return "Alice" } // compile-time error

No additional restrictions are imposed on signatures of getters and
setters that have the same name.

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

   set hashCode(x: string) {/*body*/}
   get hashCode(): long {/*body*/} // ok

.. index::
   accessor declaration
   accessor
   entity
   scope
   getter
   setter
   name
   restriction
   signature

The use of getters and setters looks identical to the use of variables.
A :index:`compile-time error` occurs if:

- Getter is used in the position of a *left-hand-side expression* in an
  :ref:`Assignment`;
- Setter is used to get a value.

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    get magicNumber(): number { return 42 }
    set randomSeed(a: number) {}

    console.log(magicNumber) // ok, getter is used
    magicNumber = 15 // compile-time error, setter is not defined

    randomSeed = 42 // ok, setter is used
    console.log(randomSeed) // compile-time error, getter is not defined

.. index::
   getter
   setter
   variable
   expression
   assignment
   value

Accessors can be declared at all places where :ref:`Top-Level Declarations`
including namespaces can be used:

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    namespace N {
        let saved_age = 0

        export get age(): number { return saved_age }
        export set age(a: number) {
            if (a < 0) { throw new Error("wrong age") }
            saved_age = a
        }
    }

    N.age = 18
    console.log(N.age)

Pattern Matching
****************

.. meta:
    frontend_status: None

*Pattern Matching* is a set of powerful features supported by most modern
programming languages. *Pattern matching* generally allows checking a value
against a pattern, and executing a corresponding action after a match is
successful. A successful match can also deconstruct a value into its constituent
parts.

The current version of |LANG| supports a simple *pattern matching* feature
called *destructuring assignment*. Other features are to be added in the
forthcoming revisions of this specification.

.. _Destructuring Assignment:

Destructuring Assignment
========================

*Destructuring assignment* allows extracting values from arrays or tuples, and
assigning them to distinct variables.

The syntax of a *destructuring assignment* is as follows:

.. code-block:: abnf

    destructuringAssignment:
        '[' lhsExpression? (',' lhsExpression?)* ']' '=' rhsExpression
        ;

The definitions of ``lhsExpression`` and ``rhsExpression`` are provided in
:ref:`Assignment`.

``rhsExpression`` must be of array type or tuple type. Otherwise, a
:index:`compile-time error` occurs.

*Destructuring assignment* can be considered a compact form of a set of
assignments (see :ref:`Simple Assignment Operator`).
Items in a *left-hand-side* expression (whether ``lhsExpression`` or none)
correspond to the sequence of elements in ``rhsExpression`` staring from the
first element (i.e., the element with the index ``0``) of an array or a tuple:

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    function foo(x: string[]) {
        let a = ""
        let b = "";
        [a, , b] = x
        // this line works the same as the previous line:
        a = x[0]; b = x[2]
    }

In the example above, ``a`` takes the value ``x[0]``, and ``b`` takes the
value ``x[2]``. If an attempt is made to have an array element with an index
greater than or equal to the length of the array, then *RangeError* is thrown
in exactly the same way as in :ref:`Array Indexing Expression`.

If ``lhsExpression`` is missing, then the corresponding element of an array or
of a tuple is ignored.

A :index:`compile-time error` occurs if:

- Type of an array element or of a tuple element is not assignable to the type
  of a corresponding ``lhsExpression`` (see :ref:`Assignability`);
- ``rhsExpression`` is of a tuple type, and ``lhsExpression`` corresponds to
  the missing tuple element.

Valid and erroneous destructuring is represented in the following example:

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    function foo(x: [string, number, string]) {
        let a: string
        let b: number
        [a] = x; // ok
        [, b, a] = x; // ok
        [, b, a,,,,] = x; // ok
        [b] = x; // compile-type error, x[0] is not assignable to 'b'
        [, b] = x; // ok
        [,,,b] = x; // compile-time error, there is no element for variable 'b'
    }
