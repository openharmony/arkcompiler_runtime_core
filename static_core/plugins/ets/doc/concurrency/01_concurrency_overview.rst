This chapter covers the |LANG| execution model and the language features that
provide support for concurrent (asynchronous and parallel) code execution.

.. _Execution model:

Execution model
***************

.. meta:
    frontend_status: Done

A program in |LANG| defines one or more |C_JOBS| that are executed by the
runtime environment. A |C_JOB| is a piece of code that can be executed
concurrently (that is, either asynchronously or in parallel with other |C_JOBS|)
and communicate its return value via the language provided mechanism. 

Given that the target platform allows for concurrent code execution, a
|C_WORKER| is an abstraction over platform provided unit of concurrency.
Typically, it will map 1:1 with OS threads. That means:

-  every |C_JOB| is hosted by a |C_WORKER| with only one |C_JOB| per |C_WORKER|
   being executed at once
-  if two or more |C_JOBS| run on different |C_WORKERS| then their code is able
   to run in parallel (this execution mode will be referred to as
   :term:`parallel execution`)
-  if several |C_JOBS| share the same |C_WORKER| then their code can never run in
   parallel (this execution mode will be referred to as :term:`asynchronous
   execution`).

A |C_JOB|'s body has the starting point (the beginning of the corresponding
piece of code) and the completion point (the end of the corresponding piece of
code). A |C_JOB|'s body can (but is not obliged to) map 1:1 to such language
entities as functions, methods or lambdas.

A |C_JOB| can have zero or more suspension points. Execution of a |C_JOB| can be
paused at a suspension point and resumed at a later moment in time. Once
suspended, a |C_JOB| allows another |C_JOB| to be executed on the same
|C_WORKER|.

Any |LANG| program implicitly defines one **main** |C_JOB|, which corresponds to
the :ref:`Program Entry Point`. The execution starts from it, and its completion
initiates the program termination sequence.

The exact language features and standard library APIs that are used for defining
|C_JOBS| and their respective suspension points are described in the subsequent
sections.

The program memory is shared between all |C_JOBS| , which allows for efficient
data sharing but implies that the developer should use the provided means of
synchronization to avoid race conditions and guarantee thread safety.


.. _Overview of concurrency features:

Overview of concurrency features
********************************

|LANG| allows for both asynchronous and parallel programming, and provides
machinery for trustworthy concurrent programs by providing the following:

- :ref:`Asynchronous execution` primitives: ``async`` / ``await`` / ``Promise``;
- :ref:`Parallel execution` API: ``EAWorker API`` / ``Taskpool API`` / 
  ``launch API``, including the structured concurrency support;
- :ref:`Synchronization` API: locks API, atomics API and other means of
     synchronization;

The :ref:`API details and restrictions` section provides the detailed API
description and the restrictions on its usage.
