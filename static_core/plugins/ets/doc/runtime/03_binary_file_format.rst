.. _RT Binary File Format:

Binary File Format
******************

The |LANG| binary file format is designed with the following goals in mind:

- Compactness,
- Fast information access,
- Low memory footprint,
- Extensibility, and
- Compatibility.

**Compactness**. Many mobile applications use numerous types, methods,
and fields. The number is very large, and does not fit into a 16-bit
unsigned integer. As a result, an application developer creates several
files, and some data cannot be deduplicated.

Current binary file format must extend these limits to conform to modern
requirements. It is achieved by making all direct references in a binary
file 4 bytes long to allow 4Gb addressing.

16-bit indices are used to refer to classes, methods and fields in
bytecode and metadata for greater compactness. A file can contain multiple
indices, each covering a part of a file as described in :ref:`RegionHeader <RT RegionHeader>`.

A file format uses :ref:`TaggedValue <RT TaggedValue>` to enable compact value storage to
store only the information available and avoid zero offset to any missing
information.

**Fast information access**. The binary file format must support fast
access to information. It means that redundant references are to be
avoided. The binary file format must also avoid data indices (e.g.,
sorted list of strings) where possible. However, the current binary file
format supports one index that is a sorted list of offsets to classes.
This compact index allows finding type definitions quickly as the
binary file is loaded.

The current binary format distinguishes between two types of classes,
fields, and methods:

- *Foreign* entities are referenced in the current binary file but
  defined in other binary files.
- *Local* entities are defined within the current binary file. 

As a local* entity and a corresponding *foreign* entity have the same header,
offsets to *foreign* and *local* entities can be used interchangeably when
a class, a field, or a method is referenced in a binary file.

A class, field or method type can be deduced at runtime by checking
whether its offset belongs to a foreign region
(``[foreign_off; foreign_off + foreign_size)``) or not. The definitions of
*foreign* entities are found in other binary files by using information
from the *foreign* entity header. The definitions of *local* entities are
found in the current binary file by using a *local* entity offset.

**Low memory footprint**. Practice proves that applications make no use
of most file data. Memory footprint of a file can be reduced significantly by
grouping the frequently-used data.
The described binary file format supports this feature by using offsets
and by not specifying the required placement of entities in relation to one
another.

**Extensibility and Compatibility**. The binary file format supports
future changes via version number. The version field in the header is
4-byte long, and is encoded as byte array to avoid misinterpretation on
platforms with different endianness. A tool that supports  version ``'N'``
of the binary file format must also support the format of version ``'N-1'``.

.. _RT Alignment:

Alignment
=========

Most entities have the 4-byte alignment in order to improve the speed of
data access. All exceptions are specified explicitly in appropriate descriptions
below.

|

.. _RT Endianness:

Endianness

non-primitive type is an offset to a :ref:`Class <RT Class>` or to a :ref:`ForeignClass <RT ForeignClass>`.
In either case, :ref:`FieldType <RT FieldType>` is ``uint32_t``. Primitive types are encoded
as follows:

     - Array of indices of the non-primitive types in a method signature.
       Each ``ref`` type in a ``shorty`` has a corresponding element

       in the ``shorty``.

.. note::
   A proper region index to resolve reference type indices can be found
   by the proto offset.

.. _RT Shorty:

Shorty Syntax
-------------

``Shorty`` is a short description of a method signature without detailed
information on reference types. A ``shorty`` begins with a return type
followed by method arguments, and ends with ``0x0``.

The ``shorty`` syntax is as follows:

.. code-block:: abnf

    Shorty:
        ReturnType ParamTypeList 0x0
        ;
    ReturnType:
        Type
        ;
    ParamTypeList:
        (Type)*
        ;

``Type`` encoding:

.. list-table::
   :width: 100%
   :align: left
   :widths: auto
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Type
     - Encoding

   * - ``void``
     - ``0x01``

   * - ``u1``
     - ``0x02``

   * - ``i8``

     - ``0x0c``

   * - ``any``
     - ``0x0d``

   * - ``ref``
     - ``0x0e``

All ``Shorty`` elements are divided into groups of four elements starting from the
beginning. Each group is encoded in ``uint16_t``. Each element is encoded in 4
bits. A group of four elements ``v1``, ``v2``, ``v3``, and ``v4`` is encoded in
``uint16_t`` as follows:

.. list-table::
   :width: 100%
   :align: left
   :widths: auto
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Values
     - Bits

   * - ``v1``
     - ``0-3``

   * - ``v2``
     - ``4-7``

   * - ``v3``
     - ``8-11``

   * - ``v4``
     - ``12-15``

If a group contains less than 4 elements, then the rest bits are filled
with ``0x0``.

       interfaces in the :ref:`ClassRegionIndex <RT ClassRegionIndex>` format. Each index is
       2-byte long, and when resolved must point at a
       :ref:`ForeignClass <RT ForeignClass>` or at a :ref:`Class <RT Class>`. The number of indices is equal
       to the number of interfaces.

.. _RT InstDebugInfo:

InstDebugInfo Format
--------------------

Debug information contains mapping between program counter of a method,
line numbers in source code, and information about local variables. The format
is derived from the DWARF Debugging Information Format, Version 3 (see subsection 6.2).
The mapping and local variable information are encoded in
the line number program, which is interpreted by the :ref:`State Machine <RT State Machine>`.
All constants the program refers to are moved into the :ref:`Constant Pool <RT Constant Pool>`
in order to deduplicate identical line number programs of different methods.

**Alignment**: None

.. list-table::
   :width: 100%

   * - ``num_parameters``
     - ``uleb128``
     - Number of method parameters.

   * - ``parameters``
     - ``uleb128[]``
     - Parameter names of a method. An array has ``num_parameters``
       elements. Each element is an offset to a :ref:`String <RT String>` or ``0`` if no name is available.

   * - ``constant_pool_size``
     - ``uleb128``
     - Size of constant pool in bytes.

   * - ``constant_pool``
     - ``uleb128[]``
     - :ref:`Constant pool <RT Constant pool>` data. Length is ``constant_pool_size`` bytes.

   * - ``line_number_program_idx``
     - ``uleb128``
     - Line number program index in the :ref:`LineNumberProgramIndex <RT LineNumberProgramIndex>`
       format. Programs have variable lengths, and end in ``DBG_END_SEQUENCE`` opcode.

.. _RT Constant Pool:

Constant Pool
-------------

Many methods have similar line number programs that differ in
variable names, variable types, and file names only. In order to deduplicate such
programs, all constants the program refers to are stored in the constant pool.
During program interpretation, the :ref:`State Machine <RT State Machine>` tracks a pointer to
the constant pool. When the :ref:`State Machine <RT State Machine>` interprets an instruction
that requires a constant argument, the machine reads memory for the value pointed to by
the constant pool pointer, and then increments the pointer. Thus,
a program has no explicit reference to constants, and can be deduplicated.

.. _RT State Machine:

State Machine
-------------

The aim of the state machine is to generate mapping between the program
counter, line numbers, and local variable information. The machine has
the following registers:

.. list-table::
   :width: 100%
   :align: left
   :widths: 22 20 58
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Name
     - Initial value
     - Description

   * - ``address``
     - 0
     - Program counter (refers to method instructions).
       Must always increase monotonically.

   * - ``line``
     - ``line_start`` from :ref:`InstDebugInfo <RT InstDebugInfo>`.
     - Unsigned integer which corresponds to a line number in source code.
       All lines are numbered beginning at 1, and the register must not have
       a value less than 1.

   * - ``file``
     - Value of ``SOURCE_FILE`` tag in ``class_data`` (see :ref:`Class <RT Class>`) or ``0``.
     - Offset to the name of a source file. If no such information is available
       (i.e., a ``SOURCE_FILE`` tag is absent in :ref:`Class <RT Class>`), then the register
       value is ``0``.

   * - ``prologue_end``
     - ``false``

.. _RT Line Number Program:

Line Number Program Format
--------------------------

A line number program consists of instructions. Each instruction has one
byte opcode and optional arguments. Depending on opcode, an argument
value can be encoded into the instruction. Otherwise, the instruction
requires the value to be read from the constant pool.

       name or ``0``.

   * - ``SET_SOURCE_CODE``
     - ``0x0a``
     - 
     - ``uleb128``
     - Sets ``source_code`` register to the value ``constant_pool_ptr``
       refers to. The argument is an offset to a :ref:`String <RT String>` which
       represents the source code or ``0``.

   * - ``SET_COLUMN``
     - ``0x0b``
     - 
     - ``uleb128``

   * - Special opcodes
     - ``0x0c .. 0xff``
     - 
     - 
     - 

Special opcodes:

:ref:`State Machine <RT State Machine>` interprets each special opcode as
follows (see DWARF Debugging Information Format subsection 6.2.5.1 Special
Opcodes):

1. Calculate the adjusted opcode:
   ``adjusted_opcode = opcode - OPCODE_BASE``.
2. Increment ``address`` register:
   ``address += adjusted_opcode / LINE_RANGE``.
3. Increment ``line`` register:
   ``line += LINE_BASE + (adjusted_opcode % LINE_RANGE)``.
4. Emit line number.
5. Set ``prologue_end`` register to ``false``.
6. Set ``epilogue_begin`` register to ``false``.

Where:

- ``OPCODE_BASE = 0x0c``: the first special opcode.
- ``LINE_BASE = -4``: the smallest line number increment.
- ``LINE_RANGE = 15``: the number of line increments presented.
